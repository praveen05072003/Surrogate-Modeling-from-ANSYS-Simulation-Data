# Surrogate Modeling

A lightweight Python implementation for building and evaluating **surrogate models** — simplified models that approximate complex systems for faster analysis and optimization.

## 🔍 Features
- Train and evaluate surrogate models on data
- Predict outputs efficiently for new inputs
- Easy to extend for custom regression or ML models

## ⚙️ Usage
```bash
python surrogate_modeling.py
